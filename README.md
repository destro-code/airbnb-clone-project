**Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup**
Identifying the design properties such as color styles and typography in a mockup is critical because:
Consistency: Ensures uniformity across the productâ€™s interface, creating a seamless user experience.
Brand Identity: Colors and fonts convey the brandâ€™s personality and values clearly and professionally.
Communication: Clear typography and color choices enhance readability and usability, guiding user attention effectively.
Efficiency: Developers and designers can work faster with well-documented design specs, reducing guesswork and revisions.
Accessibility: Proper design choices help in making the product accessible to diverse users, including those with visual impairments.
